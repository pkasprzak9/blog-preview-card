## Project Description

This project showcases a responsive blog preview card, created as part of a Frontend Mentor challenge. The main goal was to learn how to create a responsive design without using traditional @media queries, instead leveraging the CSS `clamp()` function. Additionally, the project served as a practice ground for using SCSS and SASS, focusing on file structure organization and preprocessor functions.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** Achieved using the `clamp()` function.
- **SCSS and SASS:** Utilized for enhanced CSS with better file structure and preprocessor functions.
- **SVG Handling:** Ensured SVG images are properly clipped on smaller screens.

## Technologies Used

- SCSS (SASS)
- CSS

## Learning Outcomes
